        <div class="About">
    <p>In the year 1889, I, Li Wei found myself fighting in the markets of Guangzhou, China, struggling to feed my family of five. I had always dreamed of opening my own restaurant but had to settle for cleaning people’s shoes in order to provide for my family. Despite our struggles, my family always had a deep passion for food. We would have a family meal every Saturday, using the money we’d saved up from the week to buy few ingredients. After a year of living like that, we had finally saved enough to travel to America and chase our dreams of opening a restaurant. It was a hit! Before we knew it, people were lining up for blocks on end just to have a taste of our authentic Chinese Cuisine. In the span of just four years, our restaurant has become a multi-million-dollar company. All I can say is that we’re blessed to be where we are today.
